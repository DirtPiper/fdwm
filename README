EMWM is a lightweight window manager for X11. It is derived from MWM, adding
support for UTF-8, Xinerama and Extended Window Manager Hints.

Libraries and Headers required for building:

libx11 
libxt
libxext
libxrandr
libxinerama
libxm (open-motif/motif)

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================
Run 'make' in the top-level directory of the source distribution.
When the build process finishes, run 'make install' as root.

Note On MWM Compatibility
=========================
Initially EMWM used same configuration files and X resources as MWM, this needed
to change in order to avoid conflicts. Future releases will only recognize Emwm
class in X resources, mwmrc becomes emwmrc also.
