EMWM is a fork of the MWM that shipped with Motif 2.2.1. The idea behind this is
to add support for recent X features and standards, while keeping it simple.

It should build and work on any recent Linux and FreeBSD at least. Install X11
and Motif development packages, tweak the Makefile if necessary, PREFIX and
MWMRCDIR variables in particular. Run 'make' and 'make install' as root.
