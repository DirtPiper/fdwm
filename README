FDWM is a lightweight window manager for X11. It is derived from EMWM, 
itself derived from MWM, which added support for UTF-8, Xinerama and 
Extended Window Manager Hints to MWM.

FDWM seeks to be a visually and functionally faithful clone of IRIX's
4dwm/Four Dimensional Window Manager. To be used in conjuction with
IMD/Iris Magic Desktop, an upcoming clone of IRIX's Indigo Magic Desktop.

Also consider fdwm-utils for the toolchest:

Libraries and Headers required for building:

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================
Run 'make' in the top-level directory of the source distribution.
When the build process finishes, run 'make install' as root.

Note On MWM Compatibility
=========================
Initially EMWM used same configuration files and X resources as MWM, this needed
to change in order to avoid conflicts. Future releases will only recognize Emwm
class in X resources, mwmrc becomes emwmrc also.
